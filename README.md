# Analyses of Severe Pneumonia Patients

Welcome to the repository containing Jupyter notebooks summarizing my work for my Quantitative and Systems Biology master's thesis. This is a showcase of my initial foray into data science, focusing on the critical analysis of severe pneumonia patients.  

# Main Question (TL;DR)  
*Which clinical tests are the most informative for predicting the discharge outcomes of severely-ill pneumonia patients? Can we develop a model to predict patient states and their transitions?*

# Detailed Description
This research was conducted within the Successful Clinical Response in Pneumonia Treatment (SCRIPT) project, which, by January 2022, had enrolled around 600 critically-ill patients suspected of pneumonia. The primary goal of SCRIPT is to understand the drivers behind poor outcomes and treatment responses in these patients. By collecting Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) samples from the patients, we can analyze the cellular composition and link it to clinical presentations, thereby connecting clinical data with underlying biological mechanisms.

My contribution to this project involved wrangling clinical data from Electronic Health Records (EHR) to identify factors that are informative of patient outcomes. This process made the data suitable for various modeling approaches. The outcome of this work led to the exploration of models that characterize patient states within the ICU. This work culminated in a manuscript submitted to the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) titled "Robust extraction of pneumonia-associated clinical states from electronic health records." With these identified clinical states, our aim is to develop a model that predicts transitions between states, providing insights into the biological factors driving changes in patient conditions.

# How to Navigate This Repository  
This repository consists mainly of Jupyter notebooks documenting the analysis. The notebooks are numbered in the order they were created, reflecting the progression and continuous discovery throughout the project. While you can read them in any order, following the numerical sequence will provide a coherent narrative of the data analysis journey.  

Feel free to explore these notebooks to gain insights into the analytical process and findings of this project. I hope you find this work both informative and engaging.
